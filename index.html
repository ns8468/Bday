        <p>Not many are blessed with the talent to sleep with their eyes and brain fully awake, looking out for danger and attack immediately. But my friends, our Jimmy patti kutty is one in a million. She sleeps with her eyes, brain and even her manassu kept wide open. You might think that she'll have quick reflexes, as fast as Flash even when a mosquito passes by. But no, thottu appurath bomb pottichaal polum penn ariyilla.</p>

<p>Adhaanu jimmy. Avala patti  parayaanengi nooru naava. Endh cheyyaana dhaivam blessed her with too many talents 😌 Endhaayalum, happy birthday to you jimmyyyyy ❤️</p>
<p>Forever a fan of your childishness, your love for crazy cartoons, your maturity to handle things well, your fondness for other and your pottatharam (which goes without saying) Wishing you the best of everything ahead da 🌻

Lots of love, KP</p>

You were different and we dint talk much at start but as days went by we started watching movies, going upstairs sitting there watching movies (also writing notes for meeting someone😅😂 ) and all that and we grew close. And now you are one of the most important ppl in my life. I wait every week just to see your name on my phone (aise to kabhi text nhi karti ye ladki🤦🏻‍♀️) and the 1-2 hrs we talk (ik its all nonsense mostly about movies it series or your dreams (ukwim) but it's really good to talk to you❤️ i really love those 1-2 hrs) and i always wish that you don't cut the phone uk but yeah🤷 
I really miss our movie nights 🥺 wish we get back to college soon❤️ and i hope hum humesha aise hi rahe❤️ alwaysss❤️ i love you(ik you do too so you don't have to pretend) 
Please don't you ever change, i just love the way you are namitaaaaa❤️🤩 you are amazing ❤️ yeah ig i should stop😂 anyways happy birthday once again ❤️</p>
